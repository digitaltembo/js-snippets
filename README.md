# JS Snippets
---
A few plain and simple JavaScript functions that I have found useful, including:
- Setting and toggling classes of elements
- Making a modal window
- Generating a random string
- Toggling between camelCase and non camal case strings
- Generating and submitting a form through JavaScript with the same behavior as clicking "Submit"
- Using AJAX to send a file
